Dotfiles
========

I just started to use the shell regularly and it becomes a main tool in my daily work. The main purpose of this repository is on the one hand to backup all my _dotfiles_ and on the other to keep track of the changes in my files.

My _dotfiles_ are stored in `~/dotfiles/` and symlinks are linking from my homedirectory to the files in `~/dotfiles/`. I adapted this idea from [michaeljsmalley](https://github.com/michaeljsmalley) he wrote a good article how he stores his _dotfiles_ at GitHub.
